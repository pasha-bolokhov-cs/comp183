<h1>Installing CRAPS</h1>
<p>CRAPS currently only runs on GNU/Linux systems (32- or 64-bit); it requires python 2.x (where x &gt;=4), and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #cc0000;">not python 3.x</span>.</p>
<p>If you wish to run it on your own system, download&nbsp;<a href="file:///Users/rusted_root/Documents/Camosun/COMP_183/Deryks_Notes/COMP183/CRAPS/CRAPS-3.11.tgz">this gzipped tar file</a>, unpack it in some convenient place and then read the REAME.txt file for further instructions.</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons why CRAPS might not run - or might produce strange messages - on your system:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your system is 32-bit (the binaries in the linked package are 64-bit)</li>
<li>You are running a different version of python (you will get messages about library versions, although it will still - probably - run)</li>
</ol>
<p>In both these cases it will be necessary to rebuild the system, using the supplied Makefile. See the README.txt file for more details.</p>
